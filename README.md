# Anmol Chat

This project is a chat application that allows users to create chat rooms, join existing rooms, and communicate with other users in real time. It provides features such as Google user authentication, real-time messaging, message history, and private messaging. The application is built using Firebase services, including Firestore for data storage, Authentication for user authentication, and Hosting for deployment.

## Features

1. **Google User Authentication**: Users can log in and log out using their Google accounts via Firebase Authentication.

2. **Chat Rooms**: Users can create new chat rooms, join existing rooms, and leave rooms they no longer wish to participate in.

3. **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages sent by users are displayed in the chat room in real time, allowing for instant communication.

4. **Message History**: The chat application stores the history of messages for each chat room. When a user joins a room, they can see the previous messages that were sent in that room.

5. **Private Messaging**: Users have the ability to send private messages to specific users. These private conversations are separate from the main chat rooms.
